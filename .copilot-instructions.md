**Beauty on the Lane** is a static website for a beauty salon located in Bromborough, Wirral. The site serves as the primary web presence for the business, providing information about treatments, pricing, contact details, and booking.

### Business Context
- **Business Name**: Beauty on the Lane
- **Location**: 8 Allport Lane, Bromborough, Wirral, CH62 7HP
- **Services**: Facial treatments, massage, body treatments, beauty services
- **Target Audience**: Local customers seeking professional beauty treatments
- **Domain**: beautyonthelane-wirral.co.uk (GitHub Pages deployment)

## Technology Stack

This is a **simple static website** with the following characteristics:

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5 with embedded CSS

- **JavaScript**: Don't use javascript
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (automated via repository)
- **Domain**: Custom domain configured via CNAME file
- **Assets**: SVG and PNG logos in `/images` directory

### Architecture
- **Single Page Application**: All content in `index.html`
- **Embedded Styles**: CSS is included in `<style>` tags within the HTML
- **Static Assets**: Images stored in `/images/` directory
- **No Build Process**: Direct HTML/CSS without compilation or bundling

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### HTML Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain proper document structure and indentation
- Include comprehensive meta tags for SEO and social media
- Use structured data (Schema.org) for business information
- Ensure accessibility with proper `alt` attributes and ARIA labels
- Keep the single-file architecture (don't split into multiple files unless necessary)

### CSS Guidelines
- Maintain the embedded CSS approach for simplicity
- Use a clean, minimal design aesthetic matching the current style
- Color palette: Grays (`#4a4a4a`, `#6a6a6a`, `#d8d8d8`, `#e8e8e8`, `#f5f5f5`)
- Typography: Georgia serif font family for elegance
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Maintain consistent spacing and padding patterns

### Content Guidelines
- Keep business information accurate and up-to-date
- Maintain professional, welcoming tone
- Include prices in British Pounds (£)
- Use proper British English spelling and terminology
- Ensure contact information is current and functional
- Maintain SEO-friendly content structure

## Common Tasks and Modifications

### Updating Treatment Prices
- Locate the relevant `<table>` section in `index.html`
- Update prices in the `<td>` elements
- Ensure consistent formatting (£XX format)

### Adding New Treatments
- Add new `<tr>` elements to appropriate treatment tables
- Include: Treatment name, Description, Price
- Maintain alphabetical or logical ordering
- Update any relevant structured data if needed

### Modifying Business Information
- Update contact details in the `<header>` section
- Modify Schema.org structured data in `<script type="application/ld+json">`
- Update meta tags if business description changes
- Ensure consistency across all mentions

### Adding Images
- Optimize images for web (compress, appropriate dimensions)
- Add to `/images/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include proper `alt` attributes for accessibility
- Consider lazy loading for performance if adding many images

## SEO Considerations

The site includes comprehensive SEO optimization:

- **Meta Tags**: Title, description, robots, canonical
- **Open Graph**: Facebook/social media sharing
- **Twitter Cards**: Enhanced Twitter sharing
- **Structured Data**: Schema.org BeautySalon markup
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and structure

When making changes:
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Update meta descriptions if content significantly changes
- Ensure structured data remains valid
- Test social media preview cards after major changes

## Testing and Validation

### Tools for Validation
- HTML Validator: W3C Markup Validator
- Schema Testing: Google's Rich Results Test
- Mobile Testing: Chrome DevTools responsive mode
- Performance: Google PageSpeed Insights
- SEO: Google Search Console (when live)

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Configuration
- **Source**: Repository root (not `/docs` folder)
- **Custom Domain**: Configured via `CNAME` file
- **HTTPS**: Automatically enabled
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to main branch

### Domain Management
- Domain points to GitHub Pages via DNS
- CNAME file must contain exact domain: `beautyonthelane-wirral.co.uk`
- Any domain changes require updating both DNS and CNAME file

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Content Updates
- Business hours: Update in both visible content and structured data
- Seasonal promotions: Can be added to relevant sections
- New services: Add to appropriate treatment tables
- Contact changes: Update in multiple locations (header, structured data, meta tags)

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize images before adding (use modern formats like WebP if browser support allows)
- Minimize CSS if the file grows significantly
- Consider external CSS file if embedded styles become unwieldy
- Monitor page load speed and optimize accordingly

### Security Considerations
- No backend processing means limited security concerns
- Keep any external links up-to-date and verify they're safe
- If adding JavaScript, ensure it's from trusted sources
- Regular security scans via GitHub's dependabot (though minimal dependencies)
