## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### HTML Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
- Maintain proper document structure and indentation
- Include comprehensive meta tags for SEO and social media
- Use structured data (Schema.org) for business information
- Ensure accessibility with proper `alt` attributes and ARIA labels
- Keep the single-file architecture (don't split into multiple files unless necessary)

### CSS Guidelines
- Maintain the embedded CSS approach for simplicity
- Use a clean, minimal design aesthetic matching the current style
- Color palette: Grays (`#4a4a4a`, `#6a6a6a`, `#d8d8d8`, `#e8e8e8`, `#f5f5f5`)
- Typography: Georgia serif font family for elegance
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use CSS Grid for gallery layouts
- Maintain consistent spacing and padding patterns

### Content Guidelines
- Keep business information accurate and up-to-date
- Maintain professional, welcoming tone
- Include prices in British Pounds (£)
- Use proper British English spelling and terminology
- Ensure contact information is current and functional
- Maintain SEO-friendly content structure

## Common Tasks and Modifications

### Updating Treatment Prices
- Locate the relevant `<table>` section in `index.html`
- Update prices in the `<td>` elements
- Ensure consistent formatting (£XX format)
- Test table responsiveness after changes

### Adding New Treatments
- Add new `<tr>` elements to appropriate treatment tables
- Include: Treatment name, Description, Price
- Maintain alphabetical or logical ordering
- Update any relevant structured data if needed

### Modifying Business Information
- Update contact details in the `<header>` section
- Modify Schema.org structured data in `<script type="application/ld+json">`
- Update meta tags if business description changes
- Ensure consistency across all mentions

### Adding Images
- Optimize images for web (compress, appropriate dimensions)
- Add to `/images/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include proper `alt` attributes for accessibility
- Consider lazy loading for performance if adding many images

## SEO Considerations

The site includes comprehensive SEO optimization:

- **Meta Tags**: Title, description, robots, canonical
- **Open Graph**: Facebook/social media sharing
- **Twitter Cards**: Enhanced Twitter sharing
- **Structured Data**: Schema.org BeautySalon markup
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and structure

When making changes:
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Update meta descriptions if content significantly changes
- Ensure structured data remains valid
- Test social media preview cards after major changes

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Page loads correctly in multiple browsers
- [ ] All links work (external links open in new tabs)
- [ ] Contact form displays properly (note: no backend processing)
- [ ] Images load and display correctly
- [ ] Text is readable and properly formatted
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works across devices
- [ ] Schema.org structured data validates

### Tools for Validation
- HTML Validator: W3C Markup Validator
- Schema Testing: Google's Rich Results Test
- Mobile Testing: Chrome DevTools responsive mode
- Performance: Google PageSpeed Insights
- SEO: Google Search Console (when live)

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Configuration
- **Source**: Repository root (not `/docs` folder)
- **Custom Domain**: Configured via `CNAME` file
- **HTTPS**: Automatically enabled
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to main branch

### Domain Management
- Domain points to GitHub Pages via DNS
- CNAME file must contain exact domain: `beautyonthelane-wirral.co.uk`
- Any domain changes require updating both DNS and CNAME file

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Content Updates
- Business hours: Update in both visible content and structured data
- Seasonal promotions: Can be added to relevant sections
- New services: Add to appropriate treatment tables
- Contact changes: Update in multiple locations (header, structured data, meta tags)

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize images before adding (use modern formats like WebP if browser support allows)
- Minimize CSS if the file grows significantly
- Consider external CSS file if embedded styles become unwieldy
- Monitor page load speed and optimize accordingly

### Security Considerations
- No backend processing means limited security concerns
- Keep any external links up-to-date and verify they're safe
- If adding JavaScript, ensure it's from trusted sources
- Regular security scans via GitHub's dependabot (though minimal dependencies)
